# Moviz

This is a repository for a movie database website called Moviz. Moviz utilizes the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to display lists of movies, along with each of their details.

## How to Start

To start using the application locally in your device, open the terminal and type:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Furthermore, before being able to view any movies, you would need to create a .env file with an environment variable called "API_KEY". For the API key itself, you are able to obtain it using your own TMDB account.
